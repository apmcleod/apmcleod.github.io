			<p>
			Computational methods play an important role in modeling human cognitive processing of music, as well as
			unlocking practical applications such as music retrieval and transcription. This workshop, focused on
			data-driven methods for music analysis, brings together UK researchers to share different perspectives
			and disciplinary approaches to music in a computational and/or cognitive context. The proximity of these
			universities makes this a great opportunity for researchers in the area to meet.
