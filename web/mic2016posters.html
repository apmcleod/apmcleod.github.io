				<b><i>Before Alpha-Go: Interpretation though improvisation and LISP</i></b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<b>Abstract:</b>
				Like Chess, Go is a non-chance combinatorial game - a strategy game with deceptively simple rules which go back over 3000 years. Only this year have human masters of the game been challenged and beaten by machine learning. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				This poster will outline the process undertaken to write Go / Koan, a composition which uses a &frac12; point win Game between a mid-level Dan Go player and Zen19, a Go computer, which at the time (2013) was one of the strongest of its kind.  Since then, Google's Alpha-GO has radically changed this landscape with wide reaching implications.
				</p>
				
				It will be in 4 parts:
				<ul>
					<li>An explanation the concept of gameplay in Go, and why it has been such an enormous challenge in the AI community to challenge humans within this arena.</li> 
					<li>Mapping moves to musical structures &ndash; choice and code. A brief tour of the LISP code and how it produced musical material from which to work.</li>
					<li>An extract from a performance of this piece.</li>
					<li>What questions does the new paradigm in machine learning represent? Is Alpha-Go creative?</li>
				</ul>
